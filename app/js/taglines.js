// Shell round 20 (17 Aug 2026) — the moving tagline strip, and the lines
// behind it. LAYOUT-BACKLOG.md item 12.
//
// The owner's ask: a single line under the app banner on quranrevival.html
// that cycles through short taglines, some of which carry a link — some
// opening a page inside the app, some an outside site in a new tab. They
// alone add, edit and retire the lines.
//
// FIVE DECISIONS THE OWNER TOOK BEFORE THIS WAS BUILT, all of which this
// file's shape depends on (asked 17 Aug 2026, a demo artifact shown first,
// the same way shell rounds 4-14 were agreed):
//
//   1. The strip stands EXACTLY where the static tagline stood — it is not
//      an extra line. Measured: 17-18px against the .app-tagline
//      paragraph's 20-22px, so it is 2-4px CHEAPER than what it replaces
//      and gains an Approach row at 390x844. An extra line would have cost
//      one row on three of the four phones measured. See
//      tools/i18n-verify/tagline-cost.mjs.
//   2. Quran Study page only, for now. Nothing here is Quran-specific
//      except the ayah targeting below, so adding the strip to the other
//      module pages later is a placement job, not a rewrite.
//   3. Flip, Fade and Slide up all ship, and the owner picks which is used
//      ("so i can choose often, gives a variation"). Ticker was dropped.
//   4. IT CHANGES ONCE PER VISIT, not every few seconds — "No change will
//      be frequent. A few might stay for days, a few once a day. maximum 1
//      change per session could be." That is what holdDays and
//      pickTagline() below implement, and it is why the strip is mostly a
//      still line with one noticeable movement rather than a carousel.
//   5. The lines live on the TENANT DOCUMENT, edited from taglines.html.
//      That document is already fetched by the landing page's own
//      loadContextData(), so this costs NO extra read, NO new collection
//      and NO firestore.rules change (tenants/{tenantId} is already
//      writable by canAdminIdentity() — owner/prime). Same lesson as the
//      v07.37 language sync: before adding a read, check what the startup
//      path already reads.
//
// I2: this module is PURE — no DOM, no Firebase. It takes the tenant
// document's data in and hands arrays and decisions back; the page
// controllers do the reading and writing (quranrevival.html renders the
// strip, taglines.html edits the list through safeWrite()). That is what
// lets tools test the rotation rule without a browser or a network.
//
// I4: there is no delete. Retiring a line sets status: "archived", exactly
// as subjects, trackables, classes and course offers do.
//
// I5: every line carries a permanent id. Order is a separate number, so
// re-ordering never rewrites an id and the rotation state (which remembers
// an id) survives any amount of re-ordering.
//
// I11: every line's text is language-keyed. The six lines shipped below
// carry English only and are read through langText(), which falls back
// through the Bangla catalogue keyed by the English — the same read-time
// mechanism translation phase 3 built for the seeded subject names, so
// these are in Bangla on day one without a data migration. A line the
// owner types in themselves is stored in whichever language they were
// reading at the time and can gain the other later.
