// Ayah Collections (QCR) — 26 Aug 2026.
//
// The owner's own ask, from a QCR-authoring file they uploaded: a named
// collection of āyāt pulled from across the whole Qur'an (not one surah),
// browsable as a wheel — for QCR's own 18 collections first, and built so
// any future named collection reuses the same mechanism (their own words:
// "there will be many of such topic n groups of Ayat").
//
// A demo was shown and confirmed before this was built (the standard
// practice this project uses for a genuine design/scope decision) — the
// owner then added three things the demo hadn't covered: add/remove/move
// an āyah between collections and across several at once; edit/add/archive
// the collections themselves; and a tapped āyah must land on the real,
// working Ayah Note screen, not a preview.
//
// STORAGE, decided per the owner's own "whatever is easier to do, do it":
// a real, small, tenant-scoped Firestore document —
// ayahCollections/{tenantId} — authored the same way Subjects/Approaches
// already are in Catalogue. NOT bundled platform data (the shape this
// project's own earlier proposal suggested): the owner needs to add,
// rename, archive and move things themselves, which a static JS file can't
// do without a code redeploy each time. One document per tenant, not one
// per collection — the whole thing is a few hundred short unit-key strings
// (tens of KB, nowhere near Firestore's document limit), and keeping every
// collection in one document is what makes "move an āyah from one
// collection to another" a single atomic write instead of two separate
// ones that could partially fail.
//
// I2-ISH, NOT PURE: unlike taglines.js (fully pure — its own page does the
// Firestore calls), this file also carries the read/write pair itself
// (getQcrDoc/saveQcrCollections), because every manage action here writes
// immediately rather than being batched behind a manual Save button —
// centralising the read-patch-write shape here is what keeps
// quranrevival.html from repeating it seven times over (once per action),
// the same reasoning bookmarks.js already applies to its own folder/
// bookmark helpers. Every editing helper below this point (add/rename/
// archive a collection; add/remove/move an āyah) is still pure — array in,
// array out — so the actual page controller decides when to persist.
//
// I4: a COLLECTION is a real, named, authored resource — like a Subject, a
// tagline, a bookmark — so archiving it never deletes it (setCollection
// Status, never removed-from-the-array). Membership of one āyah in one
// collection is treated differently, deliberately: it is a many-to-many tag,
// not a resource of its own, so removing/moving one is a plain array splice
// with no soft-delete flag — the same "remove-from-level" shape the owner's
// own QCR file already used, and nothing is lost by it (the āyah, and every
// OTHER collection that also lists it, are untouched).
//
// I5: every item is a permanent unit key (buildUnitKey.ayah/range), never a
// stored name — renaming a collection or re-titling anything never touches
// what a claim/bookmark/note is keyed against elsewhere in the app.
// I11: title is language-keyed, same langText() shape as every other
// tenant-authored name in this app.

// TOPIC bar round (Note view's own 🗂 drawer) -- "Yr Level" asks which year
// band(s) a GROUP (collection) targets, Yr 1 through Yr 12 plus a Regular
// adult catch-all. Deliberately a NEW, additive field (yrLevels), not a
// replacement for the existing `badge` field: badge is free text copied
// verbatim from the owner's own uploaded QCR file (values like "Y6–12",
// "All years", "Mixed — pending split") that don't map cleanly onto a fixed
// picklist, and I4 says don't reshape data that already means something.
// Stored as plain ids (I5 -- never the translated label itself); yrLevelLabel()
// is the only place one turns into display text, the same "Ruku' {ruku}"/
// "Surah {surah}" parameterized-template shape every other numbered label in
// this app already uses, so a translator writes ONE template ("Yr {n}") for
// all twelve rather than twelve separate strings.
//
// Scoped to QCR only for now, on purpose -- CLAUDE.md already carries a
// bigger, not-yet-scoped idea ("every study item labelled by year band,
// across every module") as its own future round; this is that idea's first,
// narrower instance, not that round arriving early.
