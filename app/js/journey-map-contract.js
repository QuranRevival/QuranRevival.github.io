// No Firebase, no DOM, no mutable state, no I/O. Deliberately uninvoked, and
// `noteFolders` / `notePlacements` remain unruled and unactivated: this module
// decides what they MEAN, and activating them is a separate task behind a
// deployment dependency.
//
// MMJ IS A DESTINATION OVER THE NOTE FOUNDATION, NOT A SECOND NOTEBOOK.
// Nothing here stores, copies, or re-identifies Note content. A folder holds a
// reference to a permanent `noteId` and nothing else — ADR-004's "moving a Note
// never changes its identity" is only true while that stays so.
//
// ORIGIN AND DESTINATION MAY NEVER BE DERIVED FROM EACH OTHER (ADR-010 §2).
// This module therefore never imports `study-note-binding.js`, has no concept
// of a Study Unit key, and cannot see one: auto-filing a Note under the surah
// it is about would make Destination a function of Origin and quietly collapse
// a locked distinction. The absence of that import is the enforcement.

 * that needs flattening), and `cyclic` is a word that will be shown to a
