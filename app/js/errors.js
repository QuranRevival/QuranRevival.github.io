// F-007 — Write-failure surface (Phase 0, Foundation)
//
// I15: a failed write must reach the user. Never console.error alone.
// This is how bug B1 hid for months — four collections failed silently
// while the app looked healthy.
//
// Every write in the new app goes through envelope.js, and envelope.js
// errors should be passed through safeWrite() here so failures always:
//   1. get translated into a plain sentence (no error codes, no jargon)
//   2. get logged to an in-memory session buffer (so F-008's self-check
//      screen can report "N failures this session" even after the on-screen
//      banner has been dismissed)
//   3. get shown on screen immediately, not just written to the console

import { t } from "./i18n.js";

const sessionErrorBuffer = [];

// Full app translation, phase 4: these eight sentences are the ONLY thing a
// person ever sees when a save fails, on every screen in the app -- so a
// Bangla-only reader seeing them in English is I15 half-done: the failure
// reaches them, but not in a language they can act on.
//
// They were invisible to tools/i18n-coverage.mjs (a plain object literal
// matches none of its extractor patterns), which is the fourth time the
// report has been quietly optimistic. Routing them through t() is what makes
// them countable as well as translated.
//
// Each message is a FUNCTION, not a string, for two reasons: it is
// translated at CALL time (the language can change while a page is open,
// same reason statusLabel() is a function), and writing the English inside a
// literal t("...") is what makes tools/i18n-coverage.mjs able to see it at
// all -- a bare object of strings handed to t() through a variable is
// invisible to every one of its extractor patterns.
