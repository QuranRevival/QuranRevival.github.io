// MAP Phase 3 -- Arabic word progress state model, contract v1.
//
// Pure module: no Firebase, DOM, locale, or mutable application state. The
// data layer (quran-word-progress-data.js) owns persistence; this file owns
// what a state IS, who may set it, and how one transition folds into the
// next. Keeping the two apart is what lets the transitions be tested without
// a database and the Rules be reasoned about without the UI.
//
// THREE MAP LOCKS SHAPE EVERY DECISION BELOW.
//
// 1. "Activity != Mastery". Nothing in this module turns an event into a
//    state. There is deliberately no projectWordState(event) function --
//    opening a word, hearing it, or reading its ayah produces no claim here.
//    Only an explicit, named act by a person does: claimLearnerState() and
//    decideApproval(). Phase 4's Activity evidence stays in its own module
//    and can never reach this one.
//
// 2. "A WbW word toggle/Approved state != a generic Approach claim record".
//    So this never writes to `records`. A word lives in its own collections
//    with its own vocabulary and its own permanent identity (ADR-007). The
//    Approach wheel keeps reading `records`, untouched.
//
// 3. "Arabic progress remains independent across WbW, Basic Arabic and
//    Arabic in Depth". Every stored entry therefore names its LEVEL. All
//    three levels are implemented as of issue #320: the Owner's own decision
//    (docs/governance/2026-09-26-owner-decisions.md, row 4) -- "Claiming for
//    basic n Depth is per word. (Because It's in WbW)" -- settled the DEFERRED
//    claim unit (MAP v4 s6 DEF, DDR) as the same word OCCURRENCE WbW already
//    uses. Each level's documents are keyed independently (the level is its
//    own key segment), so a claim at one level never reads or writes another.
//    Persistence for `basic`/`depth` is gated separately -- see
//    study-word-levels-readiness.js and quran-word-progress-data.js -- so a
//    level being IMPLEMENTED here (a permanent state-model fact) is distinct
//    from it being DEPLOYED (a governed decision, still pending).
//
// I6 is the fourth lock and the subtle one: a confirmation is frozen when
// marked and never recalculated. Here that is STRUCTURAL, not procedural: a
// supervisor's decision records the exact claim instant it was given for, and
// a later claim simply stops matching it. Nothing rewrites a decision, so the
// new claim gets its own look and the decision that was actually given keeps
// its reviewer, its timestamp and its place in history. This is the same
// promise records.js makes -- two different confirmation semantics in one app
// would be a defect -- reached by a shape that cannot be got wrong by a caller.
