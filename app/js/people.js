 * roleListLabel(person.roles) against `undefined` since the page was
 * built -- the Roles column has always rendered empty. Fixed here rather
 * than left alongside it, since the Edit form needs each person's real
 * current roles anyway to know which checkboxes to show ticked.
 *
 * One get() per possible role per person (deterministic ids, no
 * where(...) list query against memberships -- see updatePersonInTenant's
 * own comment for why), all fired together. Returns Map(personId ->
