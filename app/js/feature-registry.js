// F-006 — Feature registry (Phase 0, Foundation)
//
// The single list the (future) About screen reads to tell the owner, in
// plain language, what is actually built versus only planned. A feature is
// never "done" in words only -- if it isn't in here as built, the app will
// say so.
//
// Phase 0 and Phase 1 features are listed individually below, with real
// status, since both have actually been planned and built. Phases 2-14 are
// still reserved at the ID-range level only: the source document describes
// what each of those phases delivers as a whole, not a per-ID breakdown
// yet. Inventing individual feature descriptions now would be guessing,
// not reading the architecture -- each phase gets broken down into real,
// individually named features when that phase is actually planned
// (CLAUDE.md: "one phase at a time").
