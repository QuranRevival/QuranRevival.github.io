// Shell round 13 (13 Aug 2026) — one global Language preference, read by
// every module. LAYOUT-BACKLOG.md item 1.
//
// Before this, `currentLang` lived in app/quranrevival.html and NOWHERE
// else: every other page and module passed the literal "en" into
// langText(), so Bangla worked in the Quran module alone and nothing else
// in the app could show it at all, no matter what the tenant had stored.
// This module is the shared reader those pages were missing.
//
// TWO PREFERENCES, not one — the owner's own call, asked before building.
// `currentLang` used to do two different jobs at once:
//
//   1. Which language user-visible NAMES appear in (people, subjects,
//      Approaches, topics, ladders, tenant banner). That is the I11
//      concern and it is genuinely global — it must apply to every module
//      identically. That is APP LANGUAGE, and it lives under Home →
//      Settings now.
//   2. Whether the Bangla ayah TRANSLATION appears next to the English one
//      in the Quran reading panels. That is a Quran *reading* choice, not
//      an app-language one, so it lives in that module's own Reading view
//      card. That is QURAN TRANSLATION LANGUAGE.
//
// STORAGE: localStorage is the FIRST source, and js/lang-sync.js layers the
// account on top of it (v07.37 — the owner asked for the choice to follow
// them between devices: "setting again is just annoying").
//
// localStorage still comes first, and that is not a leftover — it is what
// keeps the load-speed contract intact. The language has to be known
// BEFORE first paint, or a Bangla reader watches an English page appear
// and then change under them. A network read cannot happen before first
// paint (Architecture Part 8; I9), and localStorage is synchronous, so:
//
//   1. localStorage decides what paints. Instant, no network, no flash.
//   2. After sign-in resolves, the account's stored language is compared
//      against it -- read off the userIndex document every signed-in page
//      ALREADY fetches, so this costs ZERO extra reads and needs no new
//      collection. If they disagree, adoptAppLang() below takes the
//      account's value and the page reloads once. From then on this device
//      agrees and nothing reloads again.
//   3. Changing the language writes both, so the last change made on any
//      device is what every other device picks up next time it loads.
//
// The cost of that shape, worth knowing: on a device that has NEVER opened
// the app, the first paint is in English even for a Bangla reader, until
// the account read comes back and the page reloads. One reload, once per
// device. The alternative -- blocking first paint on a network read -- is
// exactly what the load-speed contract forbids.
//
// I2: this file still never touches Firebase and imports nothing. That is
// load-bearing, not habit: pure renderers (asma-renderer.js, and nav.js
// via APP_LANGS) import getAppLang() from here, and they must never gain a
// Firebase dependency. The Firestore half lives in js/lang-sync.js, which
// hands this module a plain string.

//
// 2 Sep 2026 -- generalized to every wheel in the app (the Mastery Wheel /
// "Approach" view, Explore's own Quran-structure wheel, QCR's, and the
// Asma ul Husna wheel), each remembering its own size independently under
// its own `id` -- getWheelSize("qcr")/setWheelSize("qcr", px) is what QCR's
// own call site now uses directly, over the ORIGINAL "mm_qcr_wheel_size"
// key (wheelSizeKey()'s own special case below), so QCR's already-saved
// sizes are never lost or silently reset by this generalization.
//
// Stored as a plain pixel width, and null (never dragged) is a real, load-
// bearing third state, not just "unset" -- it is what leaves every one of
// a wheel's existing, heavily-measured CSS sizing rules (the phone cap, the
// >=900px min(55vh,480px)-style rules) fully in charge, byte-for-byte as
// before this feature existed, for anyone who never touches a handle.

// override that lets it win) once this returns a real number.

// on this page uses: no new startup read, no collection, no
// firestore.rules change (I9 untouched) -- and, unlike the Bangla-reciter
