// F-015 — Tenant/role switcher + View as (Phase 1, Identity & access)
//
// Tracks which tenant, role and roster person a signed-in user is
// currently acting as, for people who belong to more than one tenant or
// hold more than one role.
//
// Fix round (25 Aug 2026): moved from sessionStorage to localStorage, on
// the owner's own explicit ask -- Tenant/View as/Person selections must
// "take effect everywhere and remain constant" until manually changed,
// which a per-tab store can never do (a new tab, or the same tab
// reopened, used to start over). This file's own header used to justify
// sessionStorage by pointing at Stage 8's handover lock (F-016,
// study-lock.js) -- checked directly before making this change: the lock
// is a SEPARATE, independently sessionStorage-backed key
// ("qr.studyLock"), engaged only by the explicit "hand this device to a
// child" action on people.html, never by ordinary tenant/role/person
// selection. The two have never shared code or state; only the comment
// implied a dependency. Moving this file to localStorage does not touch
// study-lock.js at all, so D10's own handover-lock behaviour (still
// tab-scoped, still only for an explicit "start studying" action) is
// unaffected.
//
// "View as" is a pure client-side render-mode flag: it changes what the
// UI SHOWS, never what Firestore allows. The signed-in user's real,
// rules-granted permissions never change -- View as only ever narrows what
// a screen displays, on top of permissions the viewer already, genuinely
// has (owner/prime/platformAdmin previewing as teacher/student).
