// MAP Phase 5 (P5-C) — ADR-009 Study↔Note source binding, as PURE policy.
//
// No Firebase, no DOM, no mutable state, no I/O. Deliberately uninvoked: a
// boundary suite asserts that nothing under app/ imports it.
//
// WHAT THIS IS FOR
//
// `note-foundation.js` already writes a `noteSources` document with four
// descriptive fields — sourceKind, sourceKey, relationshipKind, provenanceKind
// — and nothing ever decided what they may contain. The repository already
// carries the drift that produces: two fixtures written months apart spell the
// same two facts four different ways (ADR-009 §Context). This module is the
// single place those four fields are decided, so a third spelling cannot be
// minted by the first surface that needs one.
//
// ACTIVITY IS NOT MASTERY (ADR-003). Nothing here names records, claimStatus,
// confirmEntry, achieved or mastered. `approachId` is carried as a descriptive
// label and is never read to decide status.
