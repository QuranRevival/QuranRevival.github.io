// MAP -- lemma-level word progress, part 1 (issue #301, re-issue of #296).
//
// The Owner's rule: "Knowing a word should mark all the same words, and all
// its forms as known as well." Owner decision (25 Sep 2026, recorded by the
// Architect): "all its forms" means the same LEMMA -- the same dictionary
// word in any inflection -- never the whole root family, and never merely
// identical spelling. Confirm once for all: the learner marks the lemma
// once and a supervisor confirms it once; every occurrence of that lemma
// then counts as known.
//
// Pure module: no Firebase, DOM, locale or mutable application state -- the
// same split app/js/quran-word-progress.js already makes between what a
// state IS and how it is persisted (quran-lemma-progress-data.js).
//
// MIRRORS quran-word-progress.js's two-lane design exactly, and REUSES its
// own transition functions rather than re-implementing them:
// claimLearnerState()/decideApproval()/resolveWordProgress() are already
// identity-agnostic -- each operates on a bare {state,at,byPersonId} /
// {review,at,byPersonId,note,forState,forClaimAt,history,historyTruncated}
// pair, never on "an ayah" or "a position". So the SAME functions apply
// unchanged to one lemma, which is what makes "the same state vocabulary
// and countsAsKnown as occurrence progress" true by construction, rather
// than by two lists staying in sync by hand.
//
// UNLIKE occurrence progress -- which bundles every word of one ayah into
// one lane document, keyed by position, because an ayah is a small, bounded
// group -- a lemma has no such natural bundle: its occurrences are
// scattered across the whole Qur'an. Measured against the real packaged
// tools/quran-data-pull/output/lemmas-index.json: 74,122 occurrences across
// 4,832 lemmas, and the most frequent lemma ("من") occurs 3,229 times
// across 2,183 distinct ayahs. Bundling by any single grouping would just
// move the sparsity problem elsewhere, so a lemma document IS one lemma:
// one document per (tenant, person, level, lemmaId), never a map that
// grows.
//
// This round builds ONLY the data layer and the Rules candidate. Nothing
// under app/ imports this file (see quran-lemma-progress-boundary.mjs,
// with a positive control) -- the UI wiring and the Word Card numbers come
// in the next round.
