// Found by opening a rendered page, not by the coverage report: the tenant
// picker on all 13 signed-in pages prints "Madrasatul Muslimeen (owner,
// prime)" and the nav's "Previewing as" notice prints a bare role id. Both
// stayed English right through phases 1-3, because the identifier reaches
// t() through a variable and no extractor pattern could see it.
//
// WHY ITS OWN FILE. Roles belong to session-context.js, but that module
// imports the Firestore SDK, and nav.js needs these labels while being --
// by its own stated contract (I2) -- a pure renderer that never touches
// Firebase. A three-line module with one dependency keeps both true.
//
// The identifiers themselves are never touched: they are what
// firestore.rules checks and what tenantMemberUids stores. Named *_LABELS
// so tools/i18n-coverage.mjs counts the wording -- see its own note on the
// label-map convention.

// printed "Preposition + Relative Pronoun" in English on an otherwise Bangla
// screen.

// Measured before building: the pulled data carries 359 DISTINCT part-of-speech
// strings, which looks unmanageable until you notice they are compositions of
// just 46 atoms joined by " + ". So this translates the atoms and rejoins them,
// rather than trying to hold 359 phrases.
//
// A second thing the measurement showed, and it is worth fixing for BOTH
// languages: a dozen of those atoms are raw Quranic Arabic Corpus codes — RES,
// PRO, PREV, EXL, INT, EXH, SUR, AVR, EQ, COM, IMPV — which tell an English
// reader exactly as little as they tell a Bangla one. They are expanded to
// real words here, so English gains from this round too.
