// Pictures in Notes (Part C, item 35; Owner decisions 72 and 81) -- the device side: make a picture small, put it in
// Firebase Storage under noteImages/{uid}/{imageId}.webp, and fetch it back to show. The pure rules (the path pattern,
// the size step-down) are in note-image-path.js; the page hands this module to the Note views as `host.images`.
//
//  * MADE SMALL FIRST, ON THE DEVICE: the picture is re-drawn on a canvas, longest side at most 1600px, saved as WebP
//    and stepped down in quality until it is about 200 KB; more than 400 KB is refused in words, never uploaded.
//    Re-drawing also strips the photo's location and camera data (EXIF): none of it survives a canvas.
//  * PRIVATE: the Storage Rules candidate (docs/governance/2026-10-storage-rules-candidate.rules) lets only the signed-in
//    person read or write their own folder. Until the Owner publishes it an upload is refused, and the refusal is
//    said in words (I15), never swallowed.
//  * NEVER A PUBLIC LINK: the Note keeps only the path. A picture is fetched with getBlob and shown from an object URL;
//    a download URL (which carries a token) is never asked for and never stored.
//  * NOTHING IS EVER DELETED (I4, D6): removing a picture from a Note leaves its file in Storage. There is no delete here
//    and the Rules candidate allows none.
