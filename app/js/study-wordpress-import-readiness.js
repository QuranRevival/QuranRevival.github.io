// Issue #265 -- WORDPRESS IMPORT (mappingmyjourney.com) PERSISTENCE READINESS
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS.
//
// This round adds optional fields to two ALREADY-DEPLOYED collections --
// `notes` gains `originalCreatedAt`, `originalModifiedAt`, `importSource`;
// `noteFolders` gains `importSource` -- so an imported Note/folder can carry
// its real WordPress dates and provenance. Deploying that Rules amendment is
// an Owner Control Gate, exactly like every other Firestore change in this
// project (CLAUDE.md's own standing rule): this round proposes a Rules
// CANDIDATE (docs/governance/2026-09-25-wordpress-import-rules-candidate.rules)
// and builds against it, and does not deploy it.
//
// This module is the gate that stops the Import page ever attempting a
// write against those undeployed fields, copying app/js/study-wbw-total-
// readiness.js's shape EXACTLY, because that module already solved this
// exact problem for a different collection and the same two rules apply
// unchanged:
//
// (1) IT DEFAULTS TO FALSE. Not "false unless something looks right" --
//     false, as a literal, with the burden of proof entirely on enablement.
//
// (2) IT NEVER INFERS READINESS FROM `firestore.rules`. The repository's
//     copy of the rules is a FILE; readiness is a fact about a LIVE Firebase
//     project. So this module reads no file, fetches nothing, and imports
//     nothing at all. The inability is the enforcement: a module that
//     imports nothing cannot consult the rules text even by accident.
//
// ENABLEMENT IS A GOVERNED DECISION, NOT AN EDIT. Flipping `ready` to true
// on its own does NOTHING: isWordpressImportPersistenceReady() requires a
// well-formed `decision` alongside it -- an authority from a closed set, a
// real date, and a reference to a record that says the deployment was
// performed and proven.
//
// THE PREVIEW WORKS WITHOUT THIS GATE (issue #265's own explicit
// requirement) -- parsing a chosen .xml file and showing folder/Note/
// reference counts touches no Firestore write at all, so
// app/import-notes.html never consults this module before rendering a
// preview. Only the Import BUTTON -- the thing that actually writes
// `originalCreatedAt`/`originalModifiedAt`/`importSource` -- is gated.
//
// This module is PURE and imports nothing. Do not give it an import.
//
// Issue #271 -- app/js/evernote-import-service.js REUSES this exact gate,
// unrenamed, rather than forking a second one. Both importers write the
// identical three optional fields (originalCreatedAt/originalModifiedAt/
// importSource) on the identical two collections (notes/noteFolders), under
// the identical Rules candidate named above -- it is the same governed
// dependency, so it gets the same governed answer. A second gate for the
// same underlying fact would just be two places that could disagree.
