// MAP Phase 4 (P4-D) — the bridge from a real Study interaction to one ADR-008
// Activity evidence event.
//
// This module holds the PURE decisions — is this interaction a completion at
// all, and which Approach does it credit — separately from the writing, so the
// rules can be tested without a database and the writing can be tested without
// a browser. It grows one tranche at a time: D1 Reading, D2 Listening,
// D3 Journaling, D4 WbW.
//
// ACTIVITY IS NOT MASTERY. Nothing here may reach records.js, claimStatus(),
// confirmEntry(), `achieved` or `mastered`, and nothing here may touch the
// legacy activity.entries[] array — evidence goes to its own subcollection and
// nowhere else. A structural suite asserts all of that by reading this source.

 *
 *   preload  — a session only exists when the caller says a PERSON started
 *              playback; nothing else can create one.
 *   buffering— it does not advance the āyah, so it cannot add coverage.
 *   looping  — heard āyahs are a SET, so a repeat adds nothing the second time.
 *   seeking  — an āyah is only credited when playback moves FORWARD off it. A
 *              backward jump credits nothing, and a forward jump credits only
 *              the āyah actually left behind, never the ones skipped over.
 *   failure  — `failed()` ends the session permanently; a failed playback can
 *              never qualify, however much was heard first.
 *
 * Coverage is measured in ĀYAHS of the selected unit, because that is the grain
 * the player reports and the unit is a bounded set of them. A whole surah
 * listened to in pieces across one session accumulates; across two sessions it
 * does not, which is the conservative reading of "a session completed it".
