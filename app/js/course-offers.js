//
// Deferred by the owner during Phase 7 round 1 (Stage B1 -- built for
// external-student/Tuition-Provider use, which D13 ranked below the
// owner's/family's own use at the time). Built now that the owner has
// confirmed external-student use is actually on the horizon.
//
// contextType is always "courseOffer" here -- "class" (Phase 10, Stage B2)
// doesn't exist yet, and nothing in a later phase is a prerequisite for an
// earlier one, so enrolments work standalone against a course offer today.
//
// Round 2 scope, flagged explicitly rather than half-built: this file gives
// course offers and enrolments a real, working data layer + admin UI. It
// does NOT yet wire bookmarks.resume's programId or activity's
// viaProgramId to a real enrolled offer while studying -- that touches
// every already-shipped study renderer (topic-study.js, routine-study.js,
// quranrevival.html, hifz-renderer.js...) and is a deliberately separate
// follow-up round, not attempted in the same sitting as the data layer
// itself. programId stays the literal string "none" on bookmark entries
// until that round.
//
// Follow-up round (11 Aug 2026, same day as Phase 13 round 1): the
// bookmarks.resume/activity.viaProgramId wiring flagged above as a
// deliberately separate round. Scoped to topic-study.js (Deen Study,
// Arabic, Hadith, General Study, Nature-Life, Life Skill) and
// routine-study.js (Health, LDOG) this round -- programIdForPersonSubject()
// below is the one shared lookup both controllers call. QuranRevival
// (quranrevival.html/hifz-renderer.js/ayah-renderer.js) and Asma ul Husna
// (asma-study.js) are NOT wired yet -- their subjectId semantics don't map
// the same way onto a course offer's subjectIds[] (Quran's own subject
// tree is a single "quran" leaf, not per-Approach; Asma's chunk subject is
// one anchor node, not per-Name) -- real follow-up, flagged rather than
// guessed at.
//
// Phase 10 addition: enrolPerson()/endEnrollment() below now also back
// classes.js's roster management (classes.js imports these functions
// directly rather than duplicating them -- contextType is the only thing
// that varies between a course offer and a class, and both share the same
// enrollments collection per the Architecture doc's own schema). The same
// two functions now also maintain teacherStudentLinks, the D9-style rules
// mirror that lets firestore.rules answer "does this teacher actually
// teach this specific student" in O(1) -- see the comment above
// recomputeTeacherStudentLink() below. This means Phase 7 round 2's
// course-offer teachers gain real, enforced scoped access (not just
// roster read) the moment this round's rules deploy, same as class
// teachers -- not a separate mechanism per contextType.

 * across every context where BOTH are actively enrolled (teacher as
 * teacher, student as student) -- the union of each such context's own
 * `subjectIds[]`. Returns `null` (not `[]`) if that union comes out empty
 * -- an admin who never named specific subjects for a shared class/offer
 * almost certainly meant "no restriction," not "assigned to nothing";
 * treating an empty result as "show nothing" would be a real regression
