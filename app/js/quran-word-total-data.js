// Issue #206 -- persistence for the whole-Qur'an/Juz running word counter.
//
// This module owns reads and writes; quran-word-total.js owns the document
// shape and the arithmetic. Same pure/impure split as quran-word-progress.js
// / quran-word-progress-data.js.
//
// GATED, and the gate is consulted FIRST in every exported function here --
// never "attempt and swallow the error". While app/js/study-wbw-total-
// readiness.js says the collection is not ready, neither function below
// calls Firestore at all. That is what keeps an ordinary word tap from ever
// throwing over an undeployed collection (the exact defect class v08.31
// fixed for Activity evidence).
//
// LOAD-SPEED CONTRACT (Architecture Part 8): nothing here runs at startup.
// getWordTotals() is called only when Explore's Juz/whole-Qur'an level is
// actually opened; recordWordTotalDelta() is called only from the same
// word-tap action that already writes the real per-occurrence state.
//
// ATOMICITY, STATED PLAINLY RATHER THAN OVERCLAIMED. `known` and each
// `byJuz.<n>.known` are updated with Firestore's `increment()` transform,
// which IS safe against concurrent writes to this counter document (lost
// updates cannot happen: increment() is applied server-side as a delta, not
// as a read-modify-write from the client). What this module does NOT do is
// join that increment into the SAME Firestore transaction as the real
// per-occurrence write in quran-word-progress-data.js -- that write path is
// already accepted, deployed-shaped and mutation-tested (MAP Phase 3), and
// rewriting its internals to share a transaction boundary with a brand-new,
// still-undeployed collection was judged a disproportionate risk for this
// round. The call site (quranrevival.html) invokes this immediately after
// the real write succeeds, the same "separate, gated, idempotent-by-design
// follow-on write" shape this codebase already accepted for MAP Phase 4's
// wbw.engaged Activity evidence. The one real gap this leaves, disclosed
// rather than hidden: if the process is interrupted between the real write
// committing and this call running, the counter can drift from the raw
// per-occurrence data until the next independent recount. A future round
// wanting a single cross-collection transaction has the tool already
// available (app/js/envelope.js's runEnvelopeTransaction) -- not used here.
//
// I4/D6: nothing here deletes. There is no "unlearn" operation; a word
// leaving "known" status moves the counter down by exactly the same
// mechanism that moved it up, never by removing a document.
