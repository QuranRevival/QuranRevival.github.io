// The Owner, 12 Oct 2026 (from real use, the Read view's 🔖 dialog with three
// people under "Assign to"): "I tried to add bookmark for children but
// couldn't add, but for myself only? yes, ok. Pls fix".
//
// What really happened, reproduced in the browser harness before anything was
// changed: the write DID land, in the child's own bookmarks/{tenant}__{child}
// document. Three things made it look as if it had not:
//   1. Nothing said so. The dialog closed, and the 🔖 on screen stayed 🔖,
//      because this page only holds the SELECTED person's document (the
//      Owner's own) in memory -- and the Owner's Bookmark menu reads only that
//      document too. A bookmark saved for a child alone was invisible from
//      where the Owner was standing.
//   2. The child's copy was tagged "For" the Owner: the For picker defaulted to
//      the selected person and did not follow the ticks, so a bookmark living
//      in Maryam's document said it was for Ahsan.
//   3. One of the Owner's own folders, chosen for a single child, handed that
//      folder's ID to the child's document, where no such folder exists -- so
//      the child's copy fell silently back to Unfiled.
//
// This module is the one save loop the four bookmark dialogs' callers
// (quranrevival.html, asma-study.js, topic-study.js, routine-study.js) used
// to carry four copies of. It fixes (3) here -- a folder is filed by its NAME
// in another person's document, found there or created there, the same way
// "+ New folder…" already creates one by name in each document -- and returns
// who it was really saved for, so the caller can say so (1). (2) is fixed in
// bookmark-popover.js, where the For picker lives.
//
// Nothing about WHERE a bookmark is written changed: still one write per
// ticked person, on that person's own document, which the bookmarks Rules
// (canRecordFor) already allow an owner/prime/guardian to write.
