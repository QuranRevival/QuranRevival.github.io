// Issue #303 -- LEMMA-LEVEL WORD PROGRESS PERSISTENCE READINESS.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS.
//
// Issue #301 built two new, additive Firestore collections (quranLemmaProgress,
// quranLemmaApprovals) plus, this round, a third (quranLemmaOccurrenceCounters --
// see quran-lemma-progress-data.js's own header for why). Deploying that Rules
// candidate (docs/governance/2026-09-26-lemma-progress-DEPLOYMENT-candidate.rules,
// regenerated this round to add the counter collection) is an Owner Control
// Gate, exactly like every other Firestore change in this project (CLAUDE.md's
// own standing rule) -- this round proposes the candidate and builds against
// it, and does not deploy it.
//
// This module is the gate that stops the app ever attempting to read or write
// any of the three lemma collections, copying app/js/study-wbw-total-
// readiness.js's shape EXACTLY, because that module already solved this exact
// problem for a different collection and the same two rules apply unchanged:
//
// (1) IT DEFAULTS TO FALSE. Not "false unless something looks right" --
//     false, as a literal, with the burden of proof entirely on enablement.
//
// (2) IT NEVER INFERS READINESS FROM `firestore.rules`. The repository's copy
//     of the rules is a FILE; readiness is a fact about a LIVE Firebase
//     project. So this module reads no file, fetches nothing, and imports
//     nothing at all. The inability is the enforcement: a module that imports
//     nothing cannot consult the rules text even by accident.
//
// ENABLEMENT IS A GOVERNED DECISION, NOT AN EDIT. Flipping `ready` to true on
// its own does NOTHING: isLemmaProgressPersistenceReady() requires a
// well-formed `decision` alongside it -- an authority from a closed set, a
// real date, and a reference to a record that says the deployment was
// performed and proven.
//
// Every exported function in quran-lemma-progress-data.js consults this gate
// FIRST and returns before ever calling Firestore while it is false -- not
// "attempt and swallow the error". While the gate is closed:
//
//   - no lemma collection is EVER read or written;
//   - the Word Card works exactly as it does today, PLUS the whole-Qur'an
//     numbers this round adds (those read only the already-deployed
//     quranWordTotals collection, gated separately by
//     study-wbw-total-readiness.js, and the already-loaded lemma occurrence
//     index -- neither needs this gate open);
//   - the "if you learn this word" delta counts only the one occurrence on
//     screen, and says so, rather than guessing at the rest of the lemma;
//   - "Mark this word known everywhere" is not shown at all, the same
//     "control that would only ever error is not offered" discipline
//     v08.31 established for Activity evidence.
//
// This module is PURE and imports nothing. Do not give it an import.
