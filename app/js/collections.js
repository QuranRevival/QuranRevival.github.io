// F-002 — Collection map (Phase 0, Foundation)
//
// Every Firestore collection name, in one place, as a constant. New code
// must import from here and never type a collection name as a bare string
// (this is the whole point: a single typo here breaks a test write
// immediately, instead of silently inventing the wrong address the way
// bug B1 did).
//
// Two generations coexist on purpose (D1 — one Firebase project, shared
// users and history):
//   - LEGACY:  what index.html reads and writes today. Untouched.
//   - TENANT:  the new schema this rebuild is creating. Named tenantPeople /
//              tenantInvites instead of people / invites so the two
//              generations can never collide (D2, approved deviation).
//
// Deliberately NOT listed: Operations, Finance, Medical records, or
// Facilities collections (Architecture layers 3.5, 4, 5, 6). CLAUDE.md is
// explicit that those are not to be built unless asked — so there are no
// names to reserve for them yet.

  ASMA_COLLECTIONS: "asmaCollections", // Asma Collections round: one doc per tenant, the same shape as ayahCollections above but for Names/phrases about Allah (see js/asma-collections.js) -- named groups, plus the ~33 Names/phrases beyond the fixed 99 in asma-data.js, plus any tenant edit to a canonical Name's own Bangla wording.

  ACTIVITY: "activity",
  BOOKMARKS: "bookmarks",
  AYAH_NOTES: "ayahNotes", // Ayah Note panel, phase 1: one doc per person (resume-shaped, not append-only) holding free per-ayah rich-text notes, keyed by unitKey. Same "small additive collection, no schema precedent to reuse" shape as D12's domains — nothing existing fits a free per-ayah journal entry.
  QURAN_WORD_PROGRESS: "quranWordProgress", // MAP Phase 3: the learner's own WbW word claims, one doc per (tenant, person, level, ayah). Deliberately NOT `records` -- a WbW word state is not an Approach claim (MAP v4 s3), and its permanent identity is ADR-007's occurrence contract, not a Study Unit key.
  QURAN_WORD_APPROVALS: "quranWordApprovals", // MAP Phase 3: a supervisor's decisions on those claims, same doc id shape, a SEPARATE collection. Split by actor role on purpose: the whole document then belongs to one (person, role) pair, so a security rule can authorise it at document level and never has to prove which key of a map a writer touched -- the limitation this file's records/subjects/trackables comments already record.
  QURAN_WORD_TOTALS: "quranWordTotals", // Issue #206: one running whole-Qur'an + per-Juz known/total document per (tenant, person), `{tenantId}__{personId}` -- CANDIDATE Rules only (docs/governance/2026-09-23-wbw-total-counter-rules-candidate.rules), never deployed by this round. Gated by app/js/study-wbw-total-readiness.js; see that module for why.
  QURAN_LEMMA_PROGRESS: "quranLemmaProgress", // Issue #301: the learner's own lemma-level claims -- "knowing a word marks all its forms known" (the same LEMMA, not the root family). One doc per (tenant, person, level, lemmaId), `{tenantId}__{personId}__{level}__{lemmaId}`. Separate from quranWordProgress (occurrence-level) on purpose: a lemma has no ayah to bundle by. CANDIDATE Rules only (docs/governance/2026-09-26-lemma-progress-rules-candidate.rules), uninvoked this round -- see app/js/quran-lemma-progress.js.
  QURAN_LEMMA_APPROVALS: "quranLemmaApprovals", // Issue #301: a supervisor's decisions on those lemma claims, same doc id shape, a SEPARATE collection -- same actor-role split as quranWordApprovals, for the identical reason (a Firestore rule cannot cheaply prove which key of a map a writer touched).
  QURAN_LEMMA_OCCURRENCE_COUNTERS: "quranLemmaOccurrenceCounters", // Issue #303: the bounded-cost answer to "how many of this lemma's occurrences already count as known on their own account" -- one doc per (tenant, person, level, lemmaId), holding `individuallyKnownByJuz` (a sparse map, at most 30 entries, never one per ayah). Seeded ONCE per (person, lemma) from a full walk (documented worst case: up to 4,366 reads for the most frequent lemma), then maintained by cheap ±1 increments from ordinary occurrence-level taps. See app/js/quran-lemma-progress-data.js's own header for why this is what keeps a lemma claim/confirm inside its ≤5-read budget. Gated by app/js/study-lemma-progress-readiness.js, same as quranLemmaProgress/quranLemmaApprovals.
