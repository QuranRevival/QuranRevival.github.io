// Decision 58 (2 Oct 2026, issue #490) -- BASIC / DEPTH LEMMA-WIDE CLAIM
// READINESS.
//
// Basic Achieved counts every word of the same root with the same meaning;
// Depth Achieved counts every word of the same root. Each is ONE lemma-wide
// claim document at its own level in quranLemmaProgress / quranLemmaApprovals /
// quranLemmaOccurrenceCounters, plus a per-level running total in
// quranWordTotals. The DEPLOYED Rules refuse a lemma document whose `level` is
// not 'wbw'; the Rules change is prepared in
// docs/governance/2026-10-02-lemma-levels-DEPLOYMENT-candidate.rules and is
// published by the OWNER (an Owner Control Gate, E1).
//
// This module is the gate that stops the app ever attempting to read or write
// a basic/depth lemma document, or a per-level totals document, before then.
// It copies app/js/study-word-levels-readiness.js's shape EXACTLY:
//
// (1) IT DEFAULTS TO FALSE -- a literal, with the burden of proof on enablement.
// (2) IT NEVER INFERS READINESS FROM `firestore.rules`: it reads no file,
//     fetches nothing and imports nothing, so it cannot consult the rules text
//     even by accident.
//
// Flipping `ready` to true alone does NOTHING: isLemmaLevelsPersistenceReady()
// also needs a well-formed `decision` (a closed-set authority, a real date and
// a reference to a record saying the deployment was performed and proven).
//
// While this gate is closed the app behaves exactly as v09.42: WbW Achieved
// counts the same word only, no basic/depth lemma or totals document is read
// or written, and the Word card shows its single "You know" line.
//
// This module is PURE and imports nothing. Do not give it an import.
