// MAP Phase 4 (P4-C) — the persisted identity of one ADR-008 Study Activity
// evidence event. Pure: no Firebase, no DOM, no locale, no mutable state.
//
// Accepted architecture (P4-B, accepted 14 Sep 2026 with two amendments):
//
//   activity/{tenantId}__{personId}__{weekKey}/evidence/{eventId}
//   eventId = eventType__trackableId__unitKey__noteSlot__dedupeScope
//
// WHY THE ID CARRIES THE IDENTITY. Firestore refuses a `create` on a document
// that already exists, so a retry of the same event is rejected by the
// DATABASE rather than by a rule, a transaction or a client check. That is the
// whole point of the shape: deduplication is not something this module has to
// get right, it is something it cannot get wrong.
//
// WHY A DELIMITER-JOINED STRING. Firestore Rules can concatenate strings and
// compare the result to the {eventId} path wildcard, so the rules RE-DERIVE
// this id from the document's own fields and refuse any id that disagrees.
// Rules cannot compute SHA-256 and cannot reproduce JSON.stringify's quoting,
// so an identity in either of those forms could only ever be taken on trust
// from the client. The earlier Phase 4 candidate used JSON.stringify; this
// does not.
//
// SEPARATOR SAFETY, verified rather than assumed. The separator is '__'.
// Every component is constrained so that none can contain '_':
//   eventType    — one of five literals
//   trackableId  — one of six literals; each contains exactly one '_', which
//                  is why it is matched against the literal SET rather than a
//                  pattern, so its own underscore can never be read as part of
//                  a separator
//   unitKey      — digits, colons, lowercase letters and one hyphen
//                  (ayah/range/surah/ruku/page)
//   noteSlot     — 32 hex characters, or the literal 'none'
//   dedupeScope  — an ISO day, or the literal 'once'
// So two different component tuples can never produce the same id.
//
// UPDATED 2026-09-28 for issue #349 (ADR-008 Amendment 3, Owner decision 20,
// docs/governance/2026-09-27-owner-decisions.md row 20): ruku and page join
// ayah/range/surah as unit types reading.completed may credit, for the Unit
// Card's "Mark as read" on those two units. Hizb and juz stay refused -- the
// Owner's own "later". Neither the event table (EVENT_APPROACHES) nor the
// Approach mapping changes: a Ruku'/Page completion credits the same
// approach_01/approach_03 pair a Surah completion already does. Persisting a
// Ruku'/Page event still needs the Rules DEPLOYMENT candidate published AND a
// second, narrower readiness gate open (app/js/study-reading-units-
// readiness.js) -- this module only widens what ADR-008's IDENTITY shape
// recognises, which is independent of whether writing is switched on.
