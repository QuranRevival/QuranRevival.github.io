// Siyagah round 14 (issue #566, decision 66) -- NOTE FLAGS AND LINKS READINESS
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Round 14 adds four optional booleans (`pinned`,
// `favourite`, `archived`, `finalised`) to the ALREADY-DEPLOYED `notes`
// collection and a NEW `noteLinks` collection. Deploying those Rules is an
// Owner Control Gate (CLAUDE.md); the candidate is
// docs/governance/2026-10-04-siyagah-round14-DEPLOYMENT-candidate.rules and is
// NOT published. So every control built against it shows but writes nothing
// until this gate reads true.
//
// This copies siyagah-sections-readiness.js's shape EXACTLY:
//
// (1) IT DEFAULTS TO FALSE -- as a literal, with the burden of proof entirely
//     on enablement.
// (2) IT NEVER INFERS READINESS FROM `firestore.rules`. A rules FILE is not a
//     fact about the LIVE project. This module reads no file, fetches nothing
//     and imports nothing at all; the inability is the enforcement.
// (3) FLIPPING `ready` ALONE DOES NOTHING: isSiyagahFlagsReady() also needs
//     a well-formed `decision` (a closed authority, a real date, a reference).
//
// ENABLEMENT IS THE ARCHITECT'S, AFTER THE OWNER PUBLISHES. A builder round
// never flips it. This module is PURE and imports nothing. Do not give it an
// import.
