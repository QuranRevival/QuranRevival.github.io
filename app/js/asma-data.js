// Phase 13 round 1 — Asma ul Husna, the 99 Names of Allah (F-141 area).
//
// Fixed platform content, same treatment Quran's own ayah text gets
// (quran-data.js) -- not tenant-authored, so it lives here as static data
// rather than as 99 separate Catalogue subject nodes. unit-keys.js already
// reserved `name:${number}` for this back in Phase 3 (F-033); number here
// is that same 1..99 index, in the standard order (the list narrated in
// Jami' at-Tirmidhi, the enumeration essentially every Islamic reference
// uses -- cross-checked against a sourced reference table before writing
// this out, not reconstructed from memory alone, given how much accuracy
// matters for content like this).
//
// meaning is language-keyed per I11.
//
// WHERE THE BANGLA ACTUALLY LIVES (full app translation, phase 6) — do not
// fill the `bn: null` slots below. They are deliberately empty, and a
// second copy of the Bangla here would be a source of drift, not a
// convenience. langText() resolves `value[lang] -> t(value.en) -> ...`, so
// the meanings are translated at READ time from js/i18n/bn.js, keyed by
// the English text exactly as written here. Two consequences worth
// knowing: tools/i18n-coverage.mjs counts them (it reads bn.js and nothing
// else, so Bangla put here would report as 0% while the screen showed
// Bangla), and a `bn` filled here would WIN over the catalogue, silently
// overriding any correction made in bn.js.
//
//   meaning  ("The Most Merciful" -> "পরম করুণাময়")   js/i18n/bn.js
//   the Name ("Ar-Rahman"        -> "আর-রহমান")      js/i18n/asma-names-bn.js
//
// The Name is split off because it is data indexed by number, exactly like
// the 114 surah names -- see that file's header for the owner's decision
// on which Bangla renderings both follow.
//
// This is deliberately separate from the screensaver's poster set
// (asma-posters.js) -- that's a different, wider collection of Names beyond
// just these 99 (91+ traditional Names, not the specific Tirmidhi
// enumeration), meant to be looked at, not claimed/tracked against. Keeping
// them apart means the 99-item study list stays exactly the well-known "99
// Names" everyone expects, while the screensaver isn't artificially
// trimmed down to only the ones that happen to overlap.
