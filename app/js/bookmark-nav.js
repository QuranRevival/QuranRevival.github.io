// Fixes round (23 Aug 2026), items 2/3 -- the nav bar's own Bookmark
// category becomes a real, live dropdown of every bookmark, not just a
// single link into bookmarks.html. The owner's own words: "opening as a
// page is needed only when organising/edits... arrangements is required,"
// so the ordinary case -- jumping straight back to a saved spot -- should
// be reachable in the same two clicks that used to only open the category.
//
// Fixes round 2 (24 Aug 2026) adds the two things that round got wrong or
// did not cover:
//   * The EXPANDED/COLLAPSED OPTION the owner actually asked for. The first
//     attempt read "enable the option for [the] Bookmark menu opening the
//     bookmark list as expanded/collapsed" as per-folder collapsing, which
//     is a different thing and was already there. It is a real setting now
//     (prefs.js's getBookmarkMenuExpanded()), deciding whether every group
//     is already open when the dropdown appears. Per-folder tapping still
//     works; the option only decides the STARTING state.
//   * GROUP BY PERSON. A bookmark can be tagged with a person now
//     (bookmarks.js's setBookmarkPersonTag()), and this dropdown can group
//     by that tag instead of by folder.
//
// Bookmark-issues round adds a third mode, GROUP BY MODULE (bookmarks.js's
// groupBookmarksByModule()) -- "everything from Deen Study," ignoring
// folders/tags entirely.
//
// I2: nav.js itself stays the pure renderer its own contract requires
// (renderBookmarkCategory() there emits only a skeleton -- a "Loading..."
// placeholder and the one link into the Manager page). This file is the
// Firebase-touching "mount" helper injected into that already-rendered DOM
// afterwards, the exact same seam js/lang-sync.js's own
// mountSyncedAppLangControl() already uses for the language picker.
//
// I9: nothing is fetched until the category is actually opened -- a
// toggle listener on the category's own <details>, not a call made at
// mount time.
//
// Two data sources, and the caller picks which one applies to it via the
// optional getBookmarksDoc (sync OR async -- awaited either way): every
// study page (topic-study.js/routine-study.js/asma-study.js,
// bookmarks.html) already loads and keeps patching its OWN bookmarksDoc
// in memory the moment a star is toggled or the Manager edits something --
// for those, this module reads that live copy straight back, for free (no
// read at all -- I9 in its strongest form) and with zero lag behind
// whatever just happened on the SAME page. quranrevival.html is the one
// exception among those: it loads bookmarksDoc LAZILY, only once the
// reading/note screen is actually opened (its own
// ensureAyahNoteDataLoaded(), a deliberate I9 choice of its own) -- so its
// getBookmarksDoc is an ASYNC function that ensures that load happens
// first, rather than a plain getter that could return the still-empty
// placeholder to someone who opens the nav dropdown from the wheel/landing
// view without ever having visited the reading screen. A page with no
// local copy at all (an admin screen that never otherwise touches
// bookmarks) omits getBookmarksDoc and falls back to a real
// getBookmarks() fetch, made fresh on every open -- the only source that
// can ever reflect a bookmark added on a different device or a different
// tab (item 4), since there is no local copy there to have gone stale.
//
// Grouping matches bookmarks.html exactly, because both read it off the
// same shared tree helpers (bookmarks.js's rootFolders/childFolders/
// bookmarksInFolder/unfiledBookmarks/groupBookmarksByPerson) -- and in
// BOTH modes the ungrouped remainder (unfiled in folder mode, untagged in
// person mode) is rendered as direct links rather than inside a fold, so it
// stays one click away exactly as the owner asked for "when there are only
// a few bookmarks (before placing them [in] organised folders)".
