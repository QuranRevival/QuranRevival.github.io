// Asma Collections — 29 Aug 2026.
//
// The owner's own ask, from a real uploaded content-authoring file (see
// asma-collections-data.js's own header): named thematic groups of Names
// and honorific phrases about Allah, browsable as a wheel — built to the
// exact same template as Ayah Collections (QCR, js/qcr.js), since a demo
// was shown and confirmed before this was built (this project's own
// standing practice for a genuine design/scope decision).
//
// TWO KINDS OF EDIT, mirroring qcr.js's own I4 split but extended by one
// more piece the owner asked for that QCR never needed (āyāt are fixed
// platform content QCR never edits; some of these Names are the owner's
// own new content):
//
//  - A COLLECTION (one of the 19 groups) is a real, named, authored
//    resource -- archiving it never deletes it, only flips its own
//    `status` field (setCollectionStatus), same as qcr.js.
//  - MEMBERSHIP of one Name in one collection is a plain array splice, not
//    I4-soft-deleted -- removing/moving one is exactly qcr.js's own
//    addItem/removeItem/moveItem, unchanged in shape.
//  - An EXTRA NAME (number >= 100, beyond the fixed 99 in asma-data.js) is
//    itself real, owner-authored content -- archiving one (setExtraName
//    Status) never deletes it either. Its own arabic/transliteration/bn/
//    ref/weak/isPhrase fields ARE editable (updateExtraName) -- new
//    content the owner curated, unlike the canonical 99.
//  - A NAME OVERRIDE (nameOverrides[number] -> a Bangla string) is the
//    owner's own correction to a CANONICAL Name's (1..99) meaning, since
//    asma-data.js itself is fixed platform content this feature was never
//    going to make tenant-editable outright. Present, it wins over
//    asma-data.js's own bn.js-routed meaning when the app is in Bangla;
//    absent, nothing changes from today. English is never overridden here
//    -- the override is the owner's own Bangla correction, not a second
//    English original.
//
// I5: every collection item is a permanent unit key (buildUnitKey.name),
// never a stored name or position -- reorganising a group, or correcting
// an extra Name's own wording, never touches what a claim/bookmark/note is
// keyed against elsewhere in the app. A number, once assigned in
// asma-collections-data.js, never changes; "auto-numbering on movement"
// (the owner's own ask) falls out of that for free -- there is nothing to
// renumber, since a Name's number was never tied to its position in any
// list to begin with.
//
// One document per tenant (asmaCollections/{tenantId}), same reasoning as
// ayahCollections/{tenantId}: the whole thing is a few hundred short
// strings, and keeping collections/extraNames/nameOverrides together in
// one document is what makes "move a Name to another group" or "correct
// its wording" a single atomic write.
