// Shell round 1 (option A, agreed with the owner 8 Aug 2026) — a small
// shared nav strip connecting the separate phase-built pages, since none of
// them link to each other today.
//
// Shell round 3 (11 Aug 2026) — the flat ~19-link list this used to render
// had outgrown itself (wrapped/crowded at ~19 links). Reorganized into five
// categories: Admin / Study Module / Operation / Bookmark / Settings.
//
// Shell round 4 (12 Aug 2026, owner's own layout discussion) — five
// categories was still one too many for a single line on a phone. Down to
// four main buttons: Home / Study / Operation / Bookmark. Admin, About and
// Settings all fold inside Home now instead of being their own top-level
// entries. Home itself is split across two places on purpose:
//   - The sign-in status, Sign In/Out buttons and the Legacy App link stay
//     in each page's own static pre-JS markup, inside a `.nav-cat-home`
//     <details> element the page already renders before any script runs
//     (same reasoning as before — see the v07.08 sign-in-flash note below).
//   - renderHomeExtras() below renders the role-gated part (Admin, About,
//     Settings) as HTML the caller injects into that same <details>, once
//     roles are known — the exact same timing Admin already had before this
//     round, just nested one level deeper now.
// Every category, including Home, starts closed and stays closed until the
// user taps it -- an earlier version of this round auto-opened a category
// when the current page was one of its own links (e.g. Study auto-expanding
// on quranrevival.html), which meant Study was open on effectively every
// visit once quranrevival.html became the landing page too, pushing real
// content down the screen. Removed per the owner's own report. The
// current-page link itself still gets highlighted (nav-current class) once
// a category is opened, so which page you're on is never actually lost.
//
// Each category (Study / Operation / Bookmark, and the page's own Home) is
// a native <details>/<summary> disclosure — no click-handler wiring needed.
// renderNavBar() itself stays a pure renderer per I2 (roles in, HTML out);
// the page's own script never has to attach anything to what it returns.
// Individual links can still carry their own ownerPrimeOnly flag within a
// category that's otherwise open to everyone (Operation: Classes/Curriculum
// are owner/prime-only, Records/Monitor/Homework/Course Offers aren't).
//
// Sign-in status, Sign In/Out and the Legacy App link are deliberately NOT
// part of renderNavBar()'s own output — they live in each page's own static
// Home markup, visible before sign-in resolves, same reason the "who"
// status text is static markup (see CLAUDE.md v07.08 — the sign-in flash
// fix). Folding them into a JS-rendered function would mean they only
// appear once roles are known, i.e. only after sign-in — exactly the flash
// this file must not reintroduce.
//
// I2: a renderer, not a module -- takes roles in, HTML out. Never touches
// Firebase, never computes roles itself; the caller already knows them from
// its own sign-in bootstrap.
//
// Shell round 13 (13 Aug 2026): Settings -> Language is now a real control.
// The one import below is a constant list of languages, not state -- see
// renderSettings() for why that keeps this file's purity intact.
